<h1>🎮 Retro Games</h1>
Retro Games is a web-based collection of retro-style games inspired by classics like Tetris, Snake, Pac-Man, and Gorillas. The project focuses on demonstrating modern web development techniques while preserving a nostalgic arcade feeling.

The core of the project is a fully functional Tetris game built from scratch using HTML5 Canvas. Users can play the game directly in the browser, control it with the keyboard, toggle music, pause/resume gameplay, and enjoy a responsive layout across devices. The project also supports offline play using Service Workers and features modern JavaScript architecture including OOP with prototypes, module structure, and jQuery interaction.

Planned features include additional games like Snake, Gorillas, and Pac-Man.
